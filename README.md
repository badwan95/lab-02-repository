Lab: 02 - jQuery Selectors and Events

## Creating a gallery of images 

* In this lab I will try to take the JSON objects from the JSON file, and then put them inside a constructor that will show up on the HTML page, 

* Also I will add a filter checkbox for images that shows the specific images using a keyword.

* I will also style the gallery like a grid using float.

* I will use jQuery DOM Manipulation to add these features.
